<h1>Using Git</h1>

<p>1. Make sure that git bash is setup in path. mkdir where u want the git repository to be initialized in.</p>
<p>2. "git init" in given folder</p>  
<p>3. "git branch [name of branch]" to create and enter a branch other than master, this however will require the existence of files, you cannot enter a branch without the presence of any files. "git branch" will return you to the master branch. a "-v" will provide more information on given branch. </p> 
<p>4. "git config --list" will present all the settings</p> 
<p>5. "git config user.name 'Ali Rassolie' --global" for </p>
<p>6. "git config user.emali '[email address]'"</p>
<p>7. "git status" to see untracked files etc</p>
<p>8. "git add [untracked file]"</p>
<p>9. "git commit -m [message associated with given commit]"</p>
<p>10. "git checkout [branch]" to enter given branch</p>
<p>11. "git push" to push the commits to the cloud</p>
<p>12. A pull request is a request to the owner of another repo to take changes you made in a branch on your fork of their repo and integrate it into theirs as if you had done the work on theirs directly. It is a request for the owner of a repository to accept your changes, that you made on your own copy of the repo ("your fork"), and "pull" them into the owner's repository. Here is a great example of a pull request on the Ruby codebase.</p>
<p>13. A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forking is not needed for the original owner of the repo</p>
