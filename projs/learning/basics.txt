Based upon what I have recently encountered.

Working with sprites. Firstly we notice that when working with a sprite project
there are several aspects to remember and need be considered. Firstly, in unity, we work
in scenes. There are ofcourse assets that are representes the object data needed to 
create the scenes, stored in the disk. Scenes are then constructed by the congregation
of these hard-stored assets. 

1. we commence by first creating a "new scene"

2. we then create an empty gameobject, that we rename player. This player-object in turn 
will be constructed by giving it multiple functions, assets and so on. 

3. It is started by selecting from the sprites, which one will represent the idle animation, select them and then
drag them to the playerobject. Subsequently, renaming the animation to for instance "PlayerIdle", 
and so on. This will create a SpriteRenderer and an Animator in the player-object

4. The saved animation, PlayerIdle also generated in the animations folder an animations-controller, that will allow us
to control the animation. 

5. we can create a separate folder in the Assets\Animations folder named Assets\Animations\AnimationControllers. 

6. If we now create a new animation by moving more sprites to the player-object, we will generate another animation, 
but not an animation-controller. 

7. The animation-controller is the
